# Merge two sorted linked lists and return it as a new list.The new list should be made by splicing together the nodes of the first two lists.

# Worst case
# Time Complexity: O(n + m), linear time

In worst case scenario, the algorithm visits each node of list say l1 and l2 where 
l1 has size n and l2 has size m.

# Space Complexity: O(1), constant space
Amount of space used is constant.
