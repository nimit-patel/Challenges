# Given a linked list, swap every two adjacent nodes and return its head. 

# Time complexity: O(n)

Two nodes are swapped at once so the number of iterations are roughly half
the size of the list. So, the time complexity is linear.

# Space complexity: O(1)

Swapping is done in place with the help of few temporary variables. So, the space
complexity is constant.
